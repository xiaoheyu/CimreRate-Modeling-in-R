# Texas crime distribution analysis and regression modeling

## Introduction
 Model and explain the spatial distribution of the crime rates in Texas. A proper regression model is build up and refined based on model diagnostics results A more accurate spatial autocorrelation regression model is established after heteroscedastic investigation.\
## Main steps
Collected demographic and crime data from ACS and DPS.\
Apply transformation on skewed data and explore the data distribution.
Select model features and set up null hypotheses.\
Fit a regression model for crime rate.\
Refine model based on collinearly analysis and residual diagnostic results.\
Detect heteroscedastic and revise the regression model.\
Conduct Moranâ€™s I test to detect spatial autocorrelation and from a spatial regression model.
